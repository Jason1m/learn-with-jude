## Overview
This folder contains a complete set of teaching materials for a 60-minute introductory Python lesson focused on basic concepts and automation. The lesson centers around a practical file organizer script that students will run and understand.

## Teaching Materials

### Scripts for Demonstration and Teaching
1. `01_variables_and_input.py` - Demonstrates variables and user input
2. `02_print_function.py` - Shows different ways to use print()
3. `03_file_operations.py` - Covers basic file operations
4. `04_loops.py` - Explains for and while loops
5. `05_logic_and_conditionals.py` - Covers if statements and logic

### Main Project Files
- `file_generator.py` - Creates sample files for testing the organizer
- `organizer.py` - The main file organization script that students will run

### Instructor Resources
- `instructor_guide.md` - Detailed lesson plan with teaching tips
- `student_handout.md` - Handout for students with key concepts
- `practice_exercises.py` - Exercises for students to practice Python basics

## Suggested Teaching Workflow

1. **Before Class**:
   - Review the instructor guide
   - Test all the scripts on your machine
   - Prepare your development environment

2. **During Class**:
   - Follow the instructor guide sequence
   - Demo the file organizer at the beginning
   - Walk through key concepts with the demonstration scripts
   - Give students time to run the organizer script themselves
   - Answer questions and troubleshoot issues

3. **After Class**:
   - Share the practice exercises
   - Provide the student handout for reference
   - Suggest next steps for continuing to learn Python

## Setup Instructions

1. Make sure Python is installed on all computers
2. Copy all files to a dedicated folder
3. Run scripts in a terminal/command prompt with:
   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```
4. For the file organizer demo:
   - First run: `python file_generator.py`
   - Then run: `python organizer.py`
   - Show the resulting folder structure
