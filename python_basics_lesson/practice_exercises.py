# 1. Ask the user for a temperature in Celsius
# 2. Convert it to Fahrenheit
# 3. Print the result

# ===== EXERCISE 5: GUESSING GAME =====
# Create a number guessing game:
# 1. Import the random module (import random)
# 2. Generate a random number between 1 and 20 (random.randint(1, 20))
# 3. Ask the user to guess the number
# 4. Tell them if their guess is too high, too low, or correct
# 5. Keep asking until they get it right
# 6. Tell them how many guesses it took

# ===== CHALLENGE: CUSTOM FILE ORGANIZER =====
# Modify the organizer.py script to:
# 1. Add a new category (like "Code" for .py, .js, .html files)
# 2. Add some file types to that category
# 3. Run your modified organizer to test it

# Instructions: Copy the organizer.py file and rename it to my_organizer.py
# Then make your modifications to that file!
