Session 1: Step-by-Step Examples
================================

This file contains progressive examples that build from simple concepts to 
more complex interactions. Use these to demonstrate how concepts connect.

For Instructors: Run each example with students, then have them modify it.
Ask "What happens if we change...?" to encourage experimentation.

# Step 2: Multiple lines create a conversation

INSTRUCTOR TIP: Point out how print() creates output line by line.
Ask students: "What if we wanted the computer to wait for our answer?"
This sets up the need for input()!

- We can make users feel welcome and encouraged
- Small touches (like counting letters) can make programs feel magical
- Programming is about solving problems AND creating experiences
