"""
TEACHING PROGRESSION:

SESSION FLOW:
1. Start by showing students the basic_quiz() function
2. Run it together, having students type along
3. Ask: "What if we wanted to add more questions?"
4. Show the enhanced_quiz() with additional features
5. For advanced students: demonstrate the mini_quiz_generator()

KEY CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED:
‚úÖ print() - Used throughout for questions and feedback
‚úÖ input() - Gets user responses and information
‚úÖ Variables - Store names, scores, answers
‚úÖ Strings - All text handling and concatenation
‚úÖ Numbers - Scoring system and basic math
‚úÖ Basic conditionals (if statements) - Check answers

CUSTOMIZATION IDEAS:
- Change questions to match your curriculum
- Add questions about other subjects (math, science, history)
- Modify scoring system (partial credit, bonus points)
- Add more personality with emojis and messages
- Create themed quizzes (sports, movies, books)

COMMON STUDENT QUESTIONS:
Q: "Why do we use .lower() with answers?"
A: So "Print", "PRINT", and "print" all count as correct!

Q: "What does += mean?"
A: It's a shortcut for score = score + 1

Q: "Can we make the quiz longer?"
A: Absolutely! Just add more questions following the same pattern.

Q: "How do we save the quiz results?"
A: Great question! We'll learn about files in a future session.

EXTENSIONS FOR FAST LEARNERS:
- Add multiple choice questions with A/B/C/D options
- Create a quiz about their favorite subject
- Add a timer element (advanced)
- Make the quiz ask random questions
- Add difficulty levels
